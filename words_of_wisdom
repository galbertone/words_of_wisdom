IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO HAVE A GOOD MIND; THE MAIN THING IS TO USE IT WELL
%
THE TIME TO REPAIR THE ROOF IS WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING
%
MINDS, LIKE BODIES, WILL OFTEN FALL INTO A PIMPLED, ILL-CONDITIONED STATE FROM MERE EXCESS OF COMFORT
%
IN LIFE, AS IN CHESS, FORETHOUGHT WINS
%
NOBODY IS ENTITLED TO YOUR TIME, MONEY, OR BODY
%
WHAT HAPPENS IS NOT AS IMPORTANT AS HOW YOU REACT TO WHAT HAPPENS
%
IF YOU WANT THINGS TO BE DIFFERENT, PERHAPS THE ANSWER IS TO BECOME DIFFERENT YOURSELF

TRY TO MAKE TODAY BETTER THAN YESTERDAY
%
FINDING WHAT ONE IS FIT TO DO AND SECURING AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT IS THE KEY TO HAPPINESS

WHEN YOU ARE ANXIOUS BECAUSE OF YOUR TO-DO LIST, TAKE COMFORT IN YOUR HAVE-DONE LIST
%
NOBODY IS TOO BUSY; IT’S JUST A MATTER OF PRIORITIES
%
IF YOU ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND A WAY OF LIFE YOU LOVE, YOU HAVE TO FIND THE COURAGE TO LIVE IT
%
NATURE AND BOOKS BELONG TO THE EYES THAT SEE THEM
%
GIVE LIGHT AND PEOPLE WILL FIND THE WAY
%
LIFE IS TOO SHORT TO BE SPENT NURSING ANIMOSITY OR REGISTERING WRONGS
%
ALL OF OUR TECHNOLOGY IS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY TO A HAPPY LIFE
%
THE LONGER YOU ARE LIVING ON AUTOPILOT, THE HARDER THE FUTURE IS GOING TO BE

 A LITTLE PROGRESS EACH DAY ADDS UP TO BIG RESULTS
%
 LIFE IS A GAME WITH RULES
%
 A SETBACK IS NEVER A BAD THING, JUST ANOTHER ONE OF LIFE’S LESSONS
%
IF YOU FIND YOURSELF FOREVER DISAPPOINTED BY YOUR LIFE, THEN YOUR PROBLEM IS YOUR EXPECTATIONS
%
 IF YOU HAVE A HEADACHE, DRINK MORE FUCKING WATER
%
TIME IS THE COIN OF YOUR LIFE
%
IF YOU ARE SAD, DO SOMETHING FOR SOMEONE ELSE, AND YOUR MOOD WILL CHANGE IMMEDIATELY
%
DO WHAT IS EASY AND YOUR LIFE WILL BE HARD

 LONG, SHORT, FLAT, IRREGULAR, AND SESAMOID?WORDS OF WISDOM OF THE FUCKING DAY
%
YOU CAN’T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE LENGTH OF YOUR LIFE, BUT YOU CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE LENGTH AND DEPTH

%
EVERYBODY TALKS A GOOD GAME, BUT IT’S WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DO THAT MATTERS
%
DIE LIKE A DRAGON, OR LIVE LIKE A PUSSY

STOP CHASING THE MONEY AND START CHASING THE PASSION
%
DO IT ALONE

STAY AWAY FROM NEGATIVE PEOPLE
%
IT’S IMPOSSIBLE FOR A PERSON TO LEARN WHAT HE THINKS HE ALREADY KNOWS
%
EVERY MORNING YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES
%
IF YOU’RE RIGHT, BUT A DICK ABOUT IT, PEOPLE WON’T SEE YOU AS THE GOOD GUY
%
NO ONE CAN DO THE MINIMUM AND REACH THEIR MAXIMUM POTENTIAL
%
THE LIFE YOU WANT IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THINGS YOU DON’T WANT TO DO
%
YOU WON’T LEARN ANYTHING BY TALKING INSTEAD OF LISTENING

YOU CHOOSE YOUR FUTURE WITH YOUR ACTIONS EACH DAY

DO NOT WATCH THE CLOCK
%
NOT EVERYONE HAS TO LIKE YOU

THINK OF STRUGGLE AS A GOOD THING

IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO LEARN, NO ONE CAN HELP YOU
%
 EVERYTHING YOU’VE EVER WANTED IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF FEAR
%
SPEND MONEY ON WHAT MAKES YOU FEEL HEALTHIER, FREER, AND SMARTER
%
 BE MISERABLE
%
 DIFFICULT PEOPLE SUCK, BUT THEY HELP YOU GROW
%
TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND ENJOY YOUR LIFE
%
IT’S ALL ABOUT CONFIDENCE
%
TACT IS THE ABILITY TO DESCRIBE OTHERS AS THEY SEE THEMSELVES
%
SOMETIMES THE SMALLEST STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IS THE BIGGEST STEP OF YOUR LIFE
%
 LIFE IS TOO SHORT TO STAY WITH SOMEONE YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE WITH
%
DON’T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU THINK
%
OPPORTUNITY IS MISSED BY MOST PEOPLE BECAUSE IT IS DRESSED IN OVERALLS AND LOOKS LIKE WORK

ASK YOURSELF
%
YOU MISS OPPORTUNITIES WHEN YOU’RE TOO AFRAID TO ASK
%
 IGNORING SMALL PROBLEMS IS HOW YOU CREATE BIG PROBLEMS
%
POSITIVE FUTURES ARE NOT MADE BY NEGATIVE THOUGHTS
%
THE BEST WAY TO AVOID DISAPPOINTMENT IS TO NOT EXPECT A THING FROM ANYONE
%
 IF YOU BLAME IT ON SOMEONE ELSE, DON’T EXPECT IT TO GET BETTER
%
 NOBODY IS OUT TO GET YOU
%
 YOU ARE WHAT YOU DO, NOT WHAT YOU SAY YOU’LL DO
%
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN OVERNIGHT SUCCESS
%
YOUR EDGE IS WHAT YOU LOVE TO DO THAT OTHERS DON’T
%
CHOOSE PEOPLE THAT CHOOSE YOU
%
 STAND BY YOUR CONVICTIONS, BUT BE WILLING TO CHANGE THEM WHEN YOU’RE PROVEN WRONG
%
 USE YOUR BLINKER
%
BE HAPPY IN THE MOMENT
%
 REGRET HURTS FAR WORSE THAN FEAR
%
YOU CAN EITHER APPEAR TO BE WEALTHY NOW OR ACTUALLY BE WEALTHY LATER
%
LIFE ISN’T ABOUT GETTING AND HAVING, IT’S ABOUT GIVING AND BEING
%
ARGUMENTS ARE ABOUT FIGURING OUT WHAT IS RIGHT, NOT WHO IS RIGHT
%
 PUTTING THINGS OFF INSTANTLY MAKES THEM HARDER AND SCARIER
%
CHANGE AND PROGRESS TAKE TIME
%
 DON’T SUCK UP TO PEOPLE
%
LEARNING HAS LIBERATED MORE PEOPLE THAN ALL THE WARS IN HISTORY
%
WHEN FACED WITH A PROBLEM YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND, DO ANY PART OF IT YOU DO UNDERSTAND, THEN LOOK AT IT AGAIN
%
NEVER SHOW YOU’RE GOOD AT THINGS YOU DON’T WANT TO DO
%
DON’T BEFRIEND SHITTY PEOPLE
%
 YELLING ALWAYS MAKES THINGS WORSE
%
IT’S EASY TO GET STUCK THINKING ABOUT A MORE EFFICIENT WAY TO DO SOMETHING YOU HAVEN’T DONE YET
%
 DON’T LET ANYONE EVER LET YOU FEEL LIKE YOU DON’T DESERVE WHAT YOU WANT MOST
%
 DON’T LET THE FEAR OF LOSING BE GREATER THAN THE EXCITEMENT OF WINNING
%
 A GREEN LIGHT DOESN’T MEAN IT IS SAFE TO GO; IT JUST MEANS IT’S LEGAL
%
PRAISE IN PUBLIC; CRITICIZE IN PRIVATE
%
THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE DON’T HAVE THE BEST OF EVERYTHING, THEY JUST MAKE THE BEST OF EVERYTHING
%
DON’T EXPLAIN YOUR PHILOSOPHY
%
YOU HAVE TO SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE WITH YOURSELF, SO YOU BETTER MAKE YOURSELF AS INTERESTING AS POSSIBLE
%
 EITHER WRITE SOMETHING WORTH READING OR DO SOMETHING WORTH WRITING
%
A BOSS USES OTHERS TO FEEL BIG
%
NO ONE EVER ACHIEVED GREATNESS BY PLAYING IT SAFE
%
 LEAVE THINGS BETTER THAN YOU FOUND THEM
%
 SAY WHAT YOU ARE FEELING BEFORE YOU RUN OUT OF TIME
%
SUCCESS IS THE SUM OF SMALL EFFORTS REPEATED DAY IN AND DAY OUT
%
IT TAKES LESS TIME TO DO A THING RIGHT THAN TO EXPLAIN WHY YOU DID IT WRONG
%
SMALL DAILY IMPROVEMENTS ARE THE KEY TO STAGGERING LONG-TERM SUCCESS
%
 EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE GOOD, BUT NOT MANY PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO MAKE THE SACRIFICES TO BE GREAT
%
 FAKE CONFIDENCE AND REAL CONFIDENCE ARE THE SAME THING
%
IF YOU COMPARE YOURSELF TO OTHERS, YOU MAY BECOME VAIN AND BITTER
%
 TRAVEL WHILE YOU ARE STILL FREE OF OBLIGATIONS
%
 JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE STRUGGLING, IT DOES NOT MEAN YOU ARE FAILING
%
 RULES FOR HAPPINESS
%
BE A DOER, NOT AN OBSERVER
%
BE ASHAMED TO DIE UNTIL YOU HAVE WON SOME VICTORY FOR HUMANITY
%
IF YOU WOULDN’T TAKE ADVICE FROM THEM, DON’T TAKE CRITICISM FROM THEM
%
TELLING SOMEONE THEY’RE STUPID DOESN’T MAKE YOU LOOK VERY SMART
%
A MAN IS GREAT BY DEEDS, NOT BY BIRTH
%
LEARN TO USE THE CRITICISM AS FUEL AND YOU WILL NEVER RUN OUT OF FUEL
%
IT’S BETTER TO OFFER NO EXCUSE THAN A BAD ONE
%
YOUR VALUE DOES NOT DECREASE BASED ON SOMEONE’S INABILITY TO SEE YOUR WORTH
%
 DO SOMETHING TODAY THAT YOUR FUTURE SELF WILL THANK YOU FOR
%
STOP ASSUMING THINGS AREN’T ATTAINABLE FOR YOU
%
 DON’T PAY SO MUCH ATTENTION TO CELEBRITIES’ PERSONAL LIVES
%
EVERY DAY IS A NEW OPPORTUNITY
%
 I WOULD RATHER DIE OF PASSION THAN OF BOREDOM
%
 WORRY IS A MISUSE OF IMAGINATION
%
 ALWAYS TALK ABOUT ANOTHER PERSON AS IF THEY WERE STANDING IN FRONT OF YOU
%
WHATEVER YOU ARE, BE A GOOD ONE
%
 CHASING SEX IS A WASTE OF TIME
%
NONE OF THE SECRETS OF SUCCESS WILL WORK UNLESS YOU DO
%
THERE IS MORE PLEASURE IN LOVING THAN BEING LOVED
%
NEVER INVEST MORE THAN YOU’RE WILLING TO LOSE
%
SUCKING AT SOMETHING IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS BEING KINDA GOOD AT SOMETHING
%
BE COMFORTABLE WITH YOURSELF AND OTHERS WILL BE COMFORTABLE WITH YOU
%
 DON’T PARTICIPATE IN GOSSIP
%
 DON’T DRINK YOUR CALORIES
%
ONE CANNOT AND MUST NOT TRY TO ERASE THE PAST MERELY BECAUSE IT DOES NOT FIT THE PRESENT
%
 IF THE SAME NEGATIVE OUTCOME KEEPS OCCURRING, THE COMMON DENOMINATOR IS YOU
%
IF YOU WANT TO CONQUER FEAR, DON’T SIT AT HOME AND THINK ABOUT IT
%


OPPORTUNITIES ARE MULTIPLIED AS THEY ARE SEIZED
%
 WE ARE ALL MAKING IT UP AS WE GO ALONG
%
A RELATIONSHIP DOESN’T HAVE TO LAST THE REST OF YOUR LIFE TO BE SUCCESSFUL
%
WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT YOURSELF IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHAT OTHERS THINK ABOUT YOU
%
AN INVESTMENT IN YOURSELF IS LOW-RISK AND HIGH-REWARD
%
 THERE IS NEVER A PERFECT TIME FOR ANYTHING
%
SET A GOAL THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO JUMP OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING
%
 NEVER USE ANONYMITY AS JUSTIFICATION TO BE AN ASSHOLE
%
 NOTHING MEMORABLE EVER HAPPENS WHEN YOU DECIDE TO STAY HOME
%
 START WHERE YOU ARE
%
ENJOY THE LITTLE THINGS, FOR ONE DAY YOU MAY LOOK BACK AND REALIZE THEY WERE THE BIG THINGS
%
 TWO THINGS KEEP US FROM HAPPINESS
%
GIVE NOT ADVICE WITHOUT BEING ASKED, AND WHEN DESIRED, DO IT BRIEFLY
%
TAKE TIME TO DELIBERATE, BUT WHEN THE TIME FOR ACTION ARRIVES, STOP THINKING AND GO IN
%
GOOD ADVICE IS NOT ALWAYS SERVED IN OUR FAVORITE FLAVOR
%
WITHOUT INITIATIVE, IMAGINATION IS SQUANDERED
%
ALL IT TAKES TO LIFT YOUR SPIRITS IS TO LIFT SOMEONE ELSE’S
%
MANY PEOPLE LACK CLARITY BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO FOCUSED ON LEARNING FAST INSTEAD OF LEARNING WELL
%
BE ADDICTED TO BETTERING YOURSELF
%
 FOR EVERY MINUTE YOU ARE ANGRY, YOU LOSE SIXTY SECONDS OF HAPPINESS
%
DON’T EXERCISE YOUR FREEDOM OF SPEECH UNTIL YOU EXERCISE YOUR FREEDOM OF THOUGHT
%
THINGS THAT NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE HAPPEN ALL THE TIME
%
 SUCK IT UP EVERY NOW AND THEN
%

MATURITY IS WHEN YOU BARELY THINK ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF YOU
%
 THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF DAYS
%
PEOPLE OFTEN CONFUSE CHARISMA FOR INTELLIGENCE, CONFIDENCE FOR COMPETENCE, AND BEAUTY FOR VIRTUE
%
YOU CAN EITHER GET BITTER OR GET BETTER
%
EVEN THE LONGEST DAYS ARE TWENTY-FOUR HOURS
%
BEING POSITIVE WON’T GUARANTEE YOU’LL SUCCEED
%
IF SOMEONE IS PRESSURING YOU TO MAKE A DECISION IMMEDIATELY, SAY NO
%
MORE PEOPLE WOULD LEARN FROM THEIR MISTAKES IF THEY WEREN’T SO BUSY DENYING THAT THEY MADE THEM
%
OPPORTUNITIES MULTIPLY AS THEY ARE SEIZED
%
 PEOPLE WON’T REMEMBER THE WORDS YOU SAID, BUT THEY WILL REMEMBER HOW IT MADE THEM FEEL

%
 THERE ARE TWO CHOICES IN LIFE
%
IF YOU’RE NOT PREPARED TO BE WRONG, YOU’LL NEVER COME UP WITH ANYTHING ORIGINAL
%
TO LEARN, YOU HAVE TO LISTEN
%
WHEN YOU CHANGE YOUR HABITUAL THOUGHTS, IT’S LIKE CHANGING THE DIRECTION OF A TRAIN
%
DON’T SETTLE DOWN WITH THE FIRST PERSON TO GIVE YOU ATTENTION
%
IF YOU DON’T PLAN YOUR LIFE, CHANCES ARE YOU WILL FALL INTO SOMEONE ELSE’S PLAN
%
 IF YOU’RE THE SMARTEST PERSON IN THE ROOM, YOU’RE IN THE WRONG ROOM
%
 IT’S OKAY TO NOT LIKE THINGS AS LONG AS YOU ARE NOT A JERK ABOUT IT

THE PROBLEM WITH TRYING TO PLEASE EVERYONE IS THAT IT STILL LEAVES ONE PERSON UNHAPPY
%
THE SECRET OF GREAT PERFORMERS IS IN THEIR DAILY RITUALS
%
PAIN IS INEVITABLE, SUFFERING IS OPTIONAL
%
FREE EDUCATION IS ABUNDANTLY AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET
%
A SOMEBODY WAS ONCE A NOBODY WHO WANTED TO AND DID
%
BE PREPARED, BECAUSE ONE DAY YOUR OPPORTUNITY WILL COME

THE MOST YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR FRIENDS IS SIMPLY BE THEIR FRIEND
%
 CONFIDENCE IS NOT “THEY WILL LIKE ME

%
A SUPERIOR MAN IS MODEST IN HIS SPEECH, BUT EXCEEDS IN HIS ACTIONS
%
 A MISTAKE MADE ONCE IS JUST A LESSON
%
IT IS NOT AGE THAT MAKES YOU WISER, IT IS THE STRUGGLE
%
 BE ENTHUSIASTIC IN THE SACK
%
 SUCCESS IS WALKING FROM FAILURE TO FAILURE WITH NO LOSS OF ENTHUSIASM
%
BE THE PERSON YOU WOULD WANT TO FOLLOW
%
THE WHOLE SECRET TO LIFE IS TO BE INTERESTED IN ONE THING PROFOUNDLY AND A THOUSAND OTHER THINGS WELL
%
 THE WORLD OWES YOU NOTHING
%
 FAILURE IS A DETOUR, NOT A DEAD-END STREET
%
 NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU TRY TO LEVITATE STUFF WITH YOUR MIND, IT WON’T WORK
%
IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO DECIDE, YOU HAVE STILL MADE A CHOICE
%
 THE WAY TO GET STARTED IS TO STOP TALKING AND START DOING
%
 IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL YOUR FOCUS HAS TO BE SO INTENSE PEOPLE THINK YOU’RE CRAZY
%
COMFORT IS A DRUG
%
NEVER STAY AT A JOB FOR LOYALTY BECAUSE THEY SURE AS SHIT AREN’T LOYAL TO YOU
%
 ENVY IS A WASTE OF TIME
%
MORE FUCK YEAH, LESS FUCK THAT
%
 YOUR LIFE WILL BE BETTER IF YOU TAKE ACTION ON THINGS YOU AVOID
%
LIFE IS TOO SHORT TO SPEND TIME WITH PEOPLE WHO SUCK THE HAPPINESS OUT OF YOU
%
 DON’T CONCERN YOURSELF OVER CELEBRITIES’ PERSONAL LIVES
%
 YOU HAVE A LIMITED TIME TO DO EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED
%
 THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOMEONE WHO DOESN’T LIKE YOU
%
 BE CURIOUS ABOUT LIFE
%
THE MOST WASTED DAY OF ALL IS THAT ON WHICH WE HAVE NOT LAUGHED
%
 IF YOU’RE SO ANGRY THAT YOU WANT TO HIT SOMEONE, JUST WALK AWAY
%
IF THE PLAN DOESN’T WORK, CHANGE THE PLAN BUT NOT THE GOAL
%
 NEVER TRUST SOMEONE WHO DOESN’T LOVE DOGS
%
IF YOU HAVE ALWAYS DONE IT THAT WAY, IT’S PROBABLY WRONG
%
HAPPINESS IS NOT SOMETHING READY MADE
%
 DON’T CONFUSE COMFORT WITH HAPPINESS
%
 IF YOU CANNOT ENJOY YOUR OWN COMPANY, YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG
%
THE EASILY OUTRAGED ARE THE EASILY MANIPULATED
%
 JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE FAMILY, IT DOESN’T GIVE THEM A FREE PASS FROM BEING ASSHOLES
%
 DON’T FIND FAULT; FIND A REMEDY
%
THE MORE YOU KNOW, THE MORE YOU KNOW YOU DON’T KNOW

 DON’T BE INTIMIDATED BY ANYONE
%
 DON’T POINT OUT PROBLEMS UNLESS YOU HAVE BETTER SOLUTIONS
%
MOST PEOPLE WILL NEVER ACCOMPLISH THE LONG TERM GREAT BECAUSE THEY SETTLED FOR THE SHORT TERM GOOD
%
PERSISTENCE WHEN AT THE BOTTOM
%
 YOU CAN NEVER BE OVERDRESSED OR OVEREDUCATED
%
TO IMPROVE IS TO CHANGE
%
IF IT COSTS YOU YOUR PEACE, IT’S TOO EXPENSIVE
%
YOU HAVE TO TAKE CHANCES SOMETIMES IF YOU’RE EVER GOING TO GET WHAT YOU WANT
%
 THE MEANING OF LIFE IS TO FIND YOUR GIFT
%
I WOULD RATHER DIE OF PASSION THAN OF BOREDOM
%
 IF IT MAKES A POINT OF TELLING YOU IT’S HEALTHY, THEN IT AIN’T

 EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT AND THAT IS OKAY
%
NEVER GIVE UP ON SOMETHING YOU CANNOT GO A DAY WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT
%
BE KIND WHENEVER POSSIBLE
%
 BE OPEN TO NEW IDEAS DAMMIT
%
NEVER UNDERESTIMATE YOUR POWER TO CHANGE YOURSELF
%
MOST PEOPLE SEEK THEIR MOUTHS BEFORE THEIR MINDS

THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOMEONE WHO THINKS YOU CAN’T SUCCEED

NO ACT OF KINDNESS, HOWEVER SMALL, IS EVER WASTED

THE HUMAN RACE IS LIKE A PUZZLE
%
YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR OWN NEEDS BEFORE YOU CAN HELP ANYONE ELSE
%
STAND FOR WHAT IS RIGHT, EVEN IF IT MEANS STANDING ALONE

%
YOU WEREN’T BORN TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH YOUR BOSS THAN YOUR FAMILY
%
IF YOU DON’T LIKE WHAT YOU’RE GETTING, THEN CHANGE WHAT YOU’RE DOING
%
YOUR BELIEFS DON’T MAKE YOU A BETTER PERSON
%
 IF YOU SPEND TOO MUCH TIME THINKING ABOUT A THING, YOU WILL NEVER GET IT DONE
%
 LEAD BY EXAMPLE
%
BEWARE OF FALSE KNOWLEDGE; IT IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN IGNORANCE
%
NEVER LET A DAY PASS THAT WILL MAKE YOU SAY, “I WILL DO BETTER TOMORROW
%
IT’S NEVER TOO LATE TO GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER
%
 MAKE SURE YOU HEAR BOTH SIDES OF THE STORY BEFORE PASSING JUDGEMENT
%
DON’T LOAN OUT WHAT YOU EXPECT TO GET BACK
%
 YOU HAVE TO FIGHT THROUGH SOME BAD DAYS TO GET TO THE BEST DAYS OF YOUR LIFE
%
GROWTH HAPPENS BY CHOICE AND NEVER BY CHANCE
%
IF YOU WANT MORE LUCK, TAKE MORE CHANCES
%
 UNDERSTAND THAT POLITICIANS ARE SHADY MOTHERFUCKERS
%
IF IT MAKES A POINT OF TELLING YOU IT’S HEALTHY, THEN IT AIN’T
%
 ASKING FOR HELP IS NOT A SIGN OF WEAKNESS
%
IF IT DOESN’T ABSORB YOU, IF IT ISN’T ANY FUN, DON’T DO IT
%
 THERE IS NO SECRET
%
 SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE ARE NOT GIFTED; THEY JUST WORK HARD AND SUCCEED ON PURPOSE
%
 IT’S ONLY A GOOD DEAL IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT
%
GOOD JUDGEMENT COMES FROM EXPERIENCE
%
 TO LIVE A CREATIVE LIFE YOU MUST LOSE YOUR FEAR OF BEING WRONG
%
LIFE IS TOUGH, MY DARLING, BUT SO ARE YOU
%
THE VOICE INSIDE YOUR HEAD THAT SAYS YOU CAN’T IS A LIAR
%
IF YOU DON’T MAKE THINGS HAPPEN THEN THINGS WILL HAPPEN TO YOU
%
EVERYONE CAN BE OUR TEACHER; TEACHING US WHAT TO DO, AND WHAT NOT TO DO
%
SHORT TERM PLEASURE IS THE FAST TRACK TO FAILURE
%
 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A PERSON TO LEARN WHAT HE THINKS HE ALREADY KNOWS
%
IF YOU CANNOT DO GREAT THINGS, DO SMALL THINGS IN A GREAT WAY
%
IF THINGS SEEM UNDER CONTROL, YOU’RE JUST NOT GOING FAST ENOUGH
%
IF YOU CONSTANTLY TALK YOURSELF OUT OF EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO DO, YOU END UP DOING NOTHING
%
YOU DON’T NEED INSPIRATION; YOU NEED DISCIPLINE
%
BEFORE YOU GIVE UP, THINK OF THE REASON YOU HELD ON FOR SO LONG
%
 OWN YOUR MISTAKES AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE
%
 WEAR YOUR DAMN SEAT BELT, AND MAKE YOUR PASSENGERS WEAR THEIR SEAT BELTS
%
FIRST SAY TO YOURSELF WHAT YOU WOULD BE; AND THEN DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO
%
 A FAILURE IS ONLY A FAILURE IF YOU LET IT STOP YOU
%
ALWAYS HOLD YOURSELF TO THE HIGHEST STANDARD, BUT NEVER EXPECT THE SAME OF OTHERS
%
GOOD THINGS DO NOT COME TO THOSE WHO WAIT
%
THE GREATEST MISTAKE YOU CAN MAKE IN LIFE IS TO CONTINUALLY THINK YOU WILL MAKE ONE
%
THERE ARE NO SECRETS TO SUCCESS
%
NOTHING WILL EVER CHANGE UNLESS YOU TAKE ACTION
%
 TRY TO UNDERSTAND THEIR OPINION BEFORE CONDEMNING THEM FOR IT
%
A MAN OF COURAGE FLEES FORWARD IN THE MIDST OF NEW THINGS
%
IF YOU CAN’T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT, THEN LET IT GO
%
IT’S BETTER TO ASK AND BE REJECTED QUICKLY THAN TO SPEND THE REST OF YOUR LIFE WONDERING “WHAT IF?”EDUCATE YOUR IGNORANT ASS
%
 YOU’RE ALLOWED TO SCREAM, YOU’RE ALLOWED TO CRY, JUST DON’T GIVE UP
%
 THE REASON YOU ARE NOT GETTING THINGS DONE IS BECAUSE YOU AREN’T DOING THEM
%
THERE IS A LIMIT TO HOW MANY STEPS YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE TODAY
%
 FIGURE OUT WHO IS SMARTER THAN YOU AND LISTEN TO THEM
%
 JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE ANONYMOUS ON THE INTERNET, IT DOESN’T MEAN YOU SHOULD TREAT PEOPLE LIKE SHIT
%
WE TURN NOT OLDER WITH YEARS, BUT NEWER EVERY DAY
%
KIND WORDS DO NOT COST MUCH, BUT THEY DO ACCOMPLISH MUCH
%
 THE GREATEST OF ALL MISTAKES IS DOING NOTHING BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY DO A LITTLE
%
HANG OUT WITH PEOPLE WHO PUSH YOU TO BECOME THE BEST VERSION OF YOURSELF
%
SELF-LOVE IS NOT SO GREAT A SIN AS SELF-NEGLECT
%
NOTHING GOOD EVER COMES FROM SITTING THERE AND FEELING SORRY FOR YOURSELF
%
BE PROUD OF YOUR SCARS
%
IT’S BETTER TO WALK ALONE THAN WITH A CROWD IN THE WRONG DIRECTION
%
 WHY BE AVERAGE WHEN YOU CAN BE FUCKING AWESOME
%
 IGNORING YOUR PROBLEMS WON’T MAKE THEM GO AWAY
%
 YOU CAN NEVER BE OVER DRESSED OR OVER EDUCATED
%
I AM ALWAYS DOING THAT WHICH I CANNOT DO, IN ORDER THAT I MAY LEARN HOW TO DO IT
%
KNOWLEDGE COMES WITH TIME, MATURITY, AND SELF-DISCOVERY
%
YOU HAVE SURVIVED EVERY SINGLE BAD DAY SO FAR
%
 THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO MAKE MONEY IN THIS WORLD
%
SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO, EVEN WHEN THEY DON’T FEEL LIKE IT
%
 WE SPEND TOO MUCH TIME LIVING IN THE “WHAT IF” AND NOT ENOUGH LIVING IN THE “WHAT IS
%
DON’T LET THE BEHAVIOR OF OTHERS DESTROY YOUR INNER PEACE
%
 WAKE UP
%
NOTHING HAS EVER BEEN ACHIEVED BY THE PERSON WHO SAYS “IT CAN’T BE DONE
%
LOGIC WILL GET YOU FROM A TO Z; IMAGINATION WILL GET YOU EVERYWHERE
%
SHOW EVERYONE RESPECT UNTIL THEY GIVE YOU A REASON NOT TO
%
TO BE OLD AND WISE, YOU MUST FIRST BE YOUNG AND STUPID
%
 THE ONLY WAY TO FAIL IS TO GIVE UP
%
 YOU CANNOT PUSH ANYONE UP THE LADDER UNLESS HE IS UNWILLING TO CLIMB
%
 NO ONE IS BUSY IN THIS WORLD
%
DON’T BE ASHAMED OF YOUR MISTAKES
%
EGOTISM IS NATURE’S COMPENSATION FOR MEDIOCRITY
%
AN APOLOGY WITHOUT CHANGE IS JUST MANIPULATION
%
 BE COMFORTABLE WITH YOURSELF AND OTHERS WILL BE COMFORTABLE WITH YOU
%
BE SO HAPPY THAT WHEN OTHERS LOOK AT YOU, THEY BECOME HAPPY TOO
%
 ABSORB WHAT IS USEFUL
%
EVERYTHING HAS ITS BEAUTY BUT NOT EVERYONE SEES IT
%
THE MOST WORTHWHILE THING IS TO TRY TO PUT HAPPINESS INTO THE LIVES OF OTHERS
%
IT’S NOT THAT WE HAVE A SHORT TIME TO LIVE, BUT THAT WE WASTE A LOT OF IT
%
IF YOU ARE SCARED OF MAKING MISTAKES, YOU WILL NEVER GROW
%
IF YOU MAKE FRIENDS WITH YOURSELF, YOU WILL NEVER BE ALONE
%
 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INSANITY AND GENIUS IS MEASURED ONLY BY SUCCESS
%
VERY OFTEN A CHANGE OF SELF IS MORE NEEDED THAN A CHANGE OF SCENE
%
LIFE HAS MANY CHAPTERS
%
TRY HARD AT EVERY SINGLE THING YOU DO TODAY
%
 YOU’RE NOT READY
%
 IT’S BETTER TO FART OVER A TOILET THAN SHIT IN YOUR PANTS

%
 PEOPLE ARE TREATED THE WAY THEY LET THEMSELVES BE TREATED
%
YOU ARE NOT DEFINED BY YOUR SITUATION
%
YOU DON’T NEED TO LOVE YOUR CAREER
%
YOUR GOALS DON’T CARE HOW YOU FEEL
%
 IT TAKES A LIFETIME TO BUILD A REPUTATION BUT ONLY A MINUTE TO FUCK IT UP

OPPORTUNITY FINDS THOSE WHO ARE DOING SOMETHING ALREADY
%
 LIFE IS NEVER BORING, BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE CHOOSE TO BE BORED
%
THE SINGLE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN COMMUNICATION IS THE ILLUSION THAT IT HAS TAKEN PLACE

THE BEST APOLOGY IS CHANGED BEHAVIOR

YOU DON’T HAVE TO HAVE EVERYTHING FIGURED OUT

%
SUCCESS CAN HAPPEN AT ANY AGE

 DISCIPLINE IS CHOOSING WHAT YOUR WANT MOST OVER WHAT YOU WANT NOW
%
 TEMPERS ARE FOR TWO YEAR OLDS
%
 ACTION ALWAYS TRUMPS INACTION

DOUBT WHOM YOU WILL, BUT NEVER YOURSELF
%
IF YOU WANT SOMETHING FROM SOMEONE, MAKE IT CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING

%
THE ART OF MEMORY IS THE ART OF ATTENTION
%
 DON’T SETTLE DOWN WITH THE FIRST PERSON TO GIVE YOU ATTENTION

 CHANGE HAPPENS WHEN THE PAIN OF STAYING THE SAME IS GREATER THAN THE PAIN OF CHANGE

GREAT THINGS NEVER COME FROM COMFORT ZONES

 FIND A WAY TO MAKE YOURSELF BETTER EVERY SINGLE DAY
%
 TAKE PRIDE IN YOUR JOB

WHEN YOU FIND AN IDEA YOU JUST CAN’T STOP THINKING ABOUT, THAT’S PROBABLY A GOOD ONE TO PURSUE
%
 WORRYING ABOUT IT DOESN’T TAKE AWAY TOMORROW’S TROUBLES, BUT IT DOES TAKE AWAY TODAY’S PEACE
%
THE ONLY COURAGE THAT MATTERS IS THE KIND THAT GETS YOU FROM ONE MOMENT TO THE NEXT
%
 THINKING AND DOING ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS
%
NO ONE IS IGNORING YOU ON PURPOSE

TRY BEING INFORMED INSTEAD OF JUST OPINIONATED

DON’T KILL YOURSELF WORKING AT A JOB THAT WOULD REPLACE YOU WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT

IF YOU WANT EXTRAORDINARY RESULTS, YOU MUST PUT IN EXTRAORDINARY EFFORT
%
 A 12 MINUTE MILE IS JUST AS FAR AS A 6 MINUTE MILE
%
IT’S NOT A LACK OF TALENT
%
 ONLY ASSHOLES TEXT AND DRIVE
%
DOUBLE DOWN ON YOUR BEST RELATIONSHIP
%
THE MOMENT THAT YOU START TO WONDER IF YOU DESERVE BETTER, YOU DO
%
 BE THE PERSON YOUR DOG THINKS YOU ARE
%
ASK YOURSELF IF WHAT YOU’RE DOING TODAY WILL GET YOU CLOSER TO WHERE YOU WANT TO BE TOMORROW
%
IF OPPORTUNITY DOESN’T KNOCK, BUILD A DOOR
%
BIG DREAMS GET ACHIEVED THROUGH SMALL STEPS

 YOU ARE HERE FOR A GOOD TIME, NOT A LONG TIME
%
IT’S OKAY TO ADMIT THAT YOU DON’T KNOW OR DON’T UNDERSTAND WHAT’S GOING ON
%
A CLEVER PERSON SOLVES A PROBLEM
%
YOU WILL NEVER ALWAYS BE MOTIVATED SO YOU MUST LEARN TO BE DISCIPLINED
%
 HOW TO BE SUCCESSFUL
%
YOU CAN WORK AS HARD AS YOU WANT TO, BUT IF YOU’RE WORKING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION, IT’S ALL FOR NOTHING
%
NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU SPEAK, YOUR ACTIONS WILL SPEAK LOUDER
%
SURROUND YOURSELF WITH PEOPLE WHO MAKE YOU THINK
%
YOUR WORST ENEMY IS YOUR FEAR OF FAILURE
%
BE NOT SIMPLY GOOD – BE GOOD FOR SOMETHING
%
THERE’S ALWAYS SOMEONE WHO ISN’T GOING TO SEE YOUR WORTH
%
MATURITY ISN’T A PRODUCT OF GROWING OLDER, BUT A PRODUCT OF GROWING WISER
%
 JUST DO WHAT WORKS FOR YOU, BECAUSE THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOMEONE WHO THINKS DIFFERENTLY
%
IF YOU’RE NOT FAILING ONCE IN A WHILE, IT PROBABLY MEANS YOU’RE NOT STRETCHING YOURSELF
%
 NEVER ACCEPT A PROMISE AS COLLATERAL
%
DISCIPLINE MEANS REMEMBERING WHAT YOU TRULY WANT

THINGS CAN GO WRONG EVEN IF YOU DO EVERYTHING RIGHT
%
YOUR HABITS WILL DICTATE THE TRAJECTORY OF YOUR LIFE

DON’T WAIT FOR INSPIRATION; IT COMES WHILE ONE IS WORKING
%
WHEN STRUGGLING TO START, WORK ON A SMALLER PART
%
IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP AND YOU HAVEN’T TOLD YOUR PARTNER, IT’S A YOU PROBLEM
%
 DON’T LET THE LITTLE THINGS BUG YOU
%
THINKING WILL NOT OVERCOME FEAR, BUT ACTION WILL
%
BE BUSY DOING, NOT BUSY WATCHING
%
CONFRONTATION SHOULD ALWAYS LEAVE A PERSON’S DIGNITY INTACT
%
JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE GOOD AT SOMETHING DOESN’T MEAN IT HAS TO BE YOUR CAREER
%
PEOPLE CAN ONLY HELP IF YOU ASK
%
 LIFE IS EASIER WHEN YOU LEARN TO ACCEPT THE APOLOGY YOU NEVER GOT
%
 DON’T FIND EXCUSES TO IGNORE OPPORTUNITY
%
 NOBODY EVER WROTE DOWN A PLAN TO BE FAT, BROKE, LAZY, AND STUPID
%
DO IT FOR THE AFTER PICTURE
%
WHAT YOU DO HAS A FAR GREATER IMPACT THAN WHAT YOU SAY
%
SAVING MORE MONEY IS GOOD
%
 PEOPLE WILL JUDGE YOU ON WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE
%
MAKE THE MOST OF YOURSELF, FOR THAT IS ALL THERE IS OF YOU
%
DON’T LET YOURSELF GET OUT OF SHAPE
%
IF YOU HIT EVERY SHOT YOU TAKE, YOU’RE STANDING TOO CLOSE TO THE NET
%
ONLY PASSIONS, GREAT PASSIONS, CAN ELEVATE THE SOUL TO GREAT THINGS
%
IF A PROBLEM EXISTS, GOOGLE HAS THE ANSWER
%
 IF YOU DO NOT GO AFTER WHAT YOU WANT, YOU WILL NEVER GET IT
%
 OVERPREPARE, THEN GO WITH THE FLOW

PUT YOUR HEART, MIND, AND SOUL INTO EVEN YOUR SMALLEST ACTS
%
DON’T VALUE THE ADVICE OF THOSE NOT QUALIFIED TO GIVE IT
%
ATTACHMENT AND EXPECTATIONS ARE THE ROOT OF HUMAN MISERY
%
 IF YOU WANT GOOD SERVICE, DON’T BE AN ASSHOLE
%
THE PERSON YOU WILL BE IN FIVE YEARS DEPENDS LARGELY ON THE INFORMATION YOU FEED YOUR MIND TODAY
%
WHEN ONE TEACHES, TWO LEARN
%
INSECURITY IS LOUD
%
YOU’VE GOT TO WAKE UP EVERY MORNING WITH DETERMINATION IF YOU ARE GOING TO GO TO BED WITH SATISFACTION
%
IT’S ONLY EMBARRASSING IF YOU ARE EMBARRASSED
%
REAL KNOWLEDGE IS TO KNOW THE EXTENT OF ONE’S IGNORANCE
%
LIFE ALWAYS OFFERS YOU A SECOND CHANCE
%
 DO NOT BLOCK OR LINGER IN THE DOORWAY
%
 FAKE HAPPINESS AND YOU MIGHT STUMBLE ON THE REAL THING
%
TAKE TIME TODAY TO APPRECIATE SOMEONE WHO DOES SOMETHING YOU TAKE FOR GRANTED
%
THE MORE YOU OVERTHINK, THE LESS YOU WILL UNDERSTAND
%
IF YOU CANNOT BE POSITIVE THEN AT LEAST BE QUIET
%
THE PEOPLE WHO CAREFULLY DESIGN THEIR DAILY ROUTINES GO FURTHER THAN THOSE WHO NEGOTIATE WITH THEMSELVES EVERY DAY
%
TAKE PRIDE IN HOW FAR YOU’VE COME
%
NEVER DISCOURAGE ANYONE WHO IS MAKING PROGRESS, NO MATTER HOW SLOW
%
WHEN THE DEBATE IS LOST, SLANDER BECOMES THE TOOL OF THE LOSERS

THE BEST WAY TO CHEER YOURSELF UP IS TO CHEER SOMEONE ELSE UP
%
GROWING UP AS A KID, WE DON’T NOTICE THAT OUR PARENTS ARE GROWING UP TOO
%
YOU HAVE TO TAKE SOME RISKS UNLESS YOU WANT TO LIVE A LIFE OF WHAT-IFS
%
SECURITY IS MOSTLY A SUPERSTITION
%
 IF SOMETHING SEEMS TOO DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE, IT’S PROBABLY WORTH DOING
%
IT TAKES AS MUCH ENERGY TO WISH AS IT DOES TO PLAN
%
IT IS POSSIBLE TO COMMIT NO MISTAKES AND STILL LOSE
%
YOUR BEST ASSET IS YOURSELF
%
THE TROUBLE WITH THE RAT RACE IS EVEN IF YOU WIN, YOU’RE STILL A RAT
%
 PEOPLE LIKE POLITE PEOPLE
%
 DON’T COMPARE YOUR BAD DAY TO SOMEONE ELSE’S GOOD DAY
%
ANYONE WHO TAKES THE TIME TO BE KIND IS BEAUTIFUL
%
REGARDLESS OF WHO YOU ARE OR WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN, YOU CAN BE WHAT YOU WANT TO BE
%
NO ONE WHO IS GREAT AT SOMETHING WAS ALWAYS GREAT AT IT
%
 REFILL THE ICE CUBE TRAY AFTER YOU USE IT
%
YOU ARE ONLY AS GOOD AS THE PEOPLE, BOOKS, AND MENTORS YOU SURROUND YOURSELF WITH
%
IF YOU HAVE MADE YOUR POINT, STOP TALKING
%
 DON’T GO OUT TRYING TO GET LAID
%
  DON’T WHINE SO MUCH
%
LIFE IS SHORT
%
WHEN YOU TALK, YOU ARE ONLY REPEATING WHAT YOU ALREADY KNOW
%
A TRUE SIGN OF INTELLIGENCE IS NOT KNOWLEDGE BUT IMAGINATION
%
INSTEAD OF COMPLAINING ABOUT YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES, GET BUSY AND START CREATING SOME NEW ONES
%
 DO WHAT YOU FEEL IN YOUR HEART TO BE RIGHT, BECAUSE YOU’LL BE CRITICIZED ANYWAY
%
BE THE REASON SOMEONE BELIEVES IN THE GOODNESS OF PEOPLE
%
EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO BE STUPID, JUST DON’T ABUSE THE PRIVILEGE
%
IF PEOPLE MAKE YOU FEEL BAD ABOUT YOURSELF, IT’S NOT BECAUSE THERE’S SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU
%
CONSISTENT SMALL STEPS AT A SUSTAINABLE PACE WIN BIG GOALS
%
 IF YOU CHOOSE TO TICKLE SOMEONE, DO NOT BE UPSET IF YOU SUSTAIN AN INJURY IN THE PROCESS
%
 YOU CAN TURN A LOSS INTO A WIN BY LEARNING SOMETHING FROM IT
%
SUCCESS DOESN’T COME FROM WHAT YOU DO OCCASIONALLY, BUT WHAT YOU DO CONSISTENTLY
%
 DON’T TRY TO FIX PEOPLE; IT DOESN’T WORK
%
THE MAN WHO ASKS A QUESTION IS A FOOL FOR A MINUTE, THE MAN WHO DOES NOT ASK IS A FOOL FOR LIFE
%
DON’T COMMENT ON A SITUATION UNTIL YOU KNOW BOTH SIDES OF THE STORY
%
YOU CAN WORK AS HARD AS YOU WANT, BUT IF IT’S IN THE WRONG DIRECTION, IT’S FOR NOTHING
%
ATTITUDES ARE CONTAGIOUS
%
STOP QUITTING EVERY TIME IT GETS HARD
%
LOVE IS GIVING SOMEONE THE ABILITY TO DESTROY YOU, AND TRUSTING THEM NOT TO DO IT
%
 REPETITION IS THE FATHER OF LEARNING
%
IF YOU DON’T ASK, YOU DON’T GET
%
 SPEAK UP WHEN SOMETHING IS BOTHERING YOU
%
 YOU DON’T NEED MONEY TO BE HAPPY, BUT IT SURE AS HELL HELPS
%
MOST EXPECT TOO MUCH FROM OTHERS, AND NOT ENOUGH FROM THEMSELVES
%
MOST OF OUR PROBLEMS ARE BECAUSE WE ACT WITHOUT THINKING OR KEEP THINKING WITHOUT ACTING
%
 YOUR PROBLEM ISN’T THE PROBLEM
%
THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF UNMAPPED COUNTRY IN US
%
DON’T BASE YOUR HAPPINESS ON OTHERS
%
OVERTHINKERS GET LUCKIER ONCE THEY ACT MORE INSTEAD
%
 IF YOU WAIT UNTIL YOU ARE READY, YOU WILL BE WAITING THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
%
 HOWEVER GOOD OR BAD A SITUATION IS, IT WILL CHANGE
%
 LIFE IS REALLY SIMPLE, BUT WE INSIST ON MAKING IT COMPLICATED
%
IT HAS BEEN MY OBSERVATION THAT MOST PEOPLE GET AHEAD IN THE TIME OTHERS WASTE
%
YOU’LL HAVE BAD TIMES, BUT IT WILL ALWAYS WAKE YOU UP TO THE GOOD STUFF YOU WEREN’T PAYING ATTENTION TO
%
THE GREATEST LESSON IN LIFE IS TO KNOW EVEN FOOLS ARE RIGHT SOMETIMES
%
HARD WORK NOW PAYS OFF LATER
%
 NEVER TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOMEONE’S KINDNESS
%
 LIFE IS TOO SHORT TO SPEND TIME HATING ANYONE
%
 READ IT BEFORE YOUR SIGN IT
%
 DON’T CLING TO A MISTAKE JUST BECAUSE YOU SPENT A LOT OF TIME MAKING IT
%
IT IS BETTER TO START AS A FOOL AND LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES THAN TO FAKE BEING A GENIUS AND LEARN NOTHING
%
 TAKE CRITICISM AS FEEDBACK AND NOT A PERSONAL ATTACK
%
IF YOU LOVE LIFE, DON’T WASTE TIME
%
 IF YOU HAVE TO DO IT ANYWAY, DON’T BE A WHINY LITTLE BITCH ABOUT IT
%
 BE THE REASON SOMEONE BELIEVES IN THE GOODNESS OF PEOPLE
%
SOMETIMES A HYPOCRITE IS JUST A MAN IN THE PROCESS OF CHANGING
%
LAUGHTER IS AN INSTANT VACATION
%
CHANGE YOUR LIFE TODAY
%
 YOU CAN’T CLIMB THE LADDER OF SUCCESS WITH YOUR HANDS IN YOUR POCKETS
%
 IF YOUR LIFE SUDDENLY GOT A LITTLE BIT HARDER, IT PROBABLY MEANS YOU JUST LEVELED UP
%
YOU CAN AVOID REALITY, BUT YOU CANNOT AVOID THE CONSEQUENCES OF AVOIDING REALITY
%
A LOSER IS SOMEONE WHO IS SO AFRAID OF NOT WINNING, THEY DON’T EVEN TRY
%
 THOSE WHO COMPLAIN THE MOST ACCOMPLISH THE LEAST
%
 COURAGE IS A LEARNED SKILL
%
THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE OF SPEAKING THE TRUTH IS THAT YOU DON’T HAVE TO REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID
%
JUST BEING NICE TO A STRANGER CAN MAKE THEIR DAY
%
 DON’T TAKE SIDES UNLESS YOU KNOW ALL THE DETAILS
%
 THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN ORDEAL AND AN ADVENTURE IS YOUR ATTITUDE
%
IF YOU AREN’T HAPPY WITH YESTERDAY, DO SOMETHING TODAY TO CHANGE IT
%
WHEN EXPOSING A CRIME IS TREATED AS COMMITTING A CRIME, YOU ARE BEING RULED BY CRIMINALS
%
STOP SHRINKING TO FIT PLACES YOU’VE OUTGROWN
%
 EFFORT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTE
%
IT’S EASY TO STAND WITH THE CROWD
%
MATURITY IS ACHIEVED WHEN A PERSON POSTPONES IMMEDIATE PLEASURES FOR LONG-TERM VALUES
%
THE MOST VALUABLE THING YOU HAVE IS YOUR ATTENTION
%
WHEREVER YOU ARE, BE ALL THERE
%
READ, OBSERVE, LISTEN INTENSELY
%
 SOMEONE WHO IS NICE TO YOU BUT MEAN TO SERVICE STAFF IS NOT A NICE PERSON
%
THERE IS NO SUCH THING IN ANYONE’S LIFE AS AN UNIMPORTANT DAY
%
 WE DON’T HAVE TO AGREE ON ANYTHING TO BE KIND TO EACH OTHER
%
IT’S OKAY TO CHANGE YOUR MIND, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU’RE WRONG
%
YOU ONLY NEED YOUR APPROVAL
%
 THOSE WHO DON’T HAVE TIME FOR EXERCISE WILL SOONER OR LATER HAVE TO FIND TIME FOR ILLNESS
%
 PLANNING PREVENTS PAIN
%
TRAVEL FAR ENOUGH, YOU MEET YOURSELF
%
WISE PEOPLE ARE NOT ALWAYS SILENT, BUT THEY KNOW WHEN TO BE
%
PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS DOUBT
%
 ONLY PUT OFF UNTIL TOMORROW WHAT YOU ARE WILLING TO DIE HAVING LEFT UNDONE
%
THE TRUE SECRET OF HAPPINESS LIES IN TAKING A GENUINE INTEREST IN ALL THE DETAILS OF DAILY LIFE
%
DON’T BE PUSHED BY YOUR PROBLEMS

SOCIAL MEDIA IS AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY

YOU CANNOT CLIMB A MOUNTAIN WITH YOUR HANDS IN YOUR POCKETS
%
FAILURE IS THE CONDIMENT THAT GIVES SUCCESS ITS FLAVOR
%
DON’T PUT CELEBRITIES ON RIDICULOUS PEDESTALS
%
 IF YOU AREN’T HAPPY SINGLE, YOU WON’T BE HAPPY IN A RELATIONSHIP
%
YOU CANNOT DO ALL THE GOOD THE WORLD NEEDS, BUT THE WORLD NEEDS ALL THE GOOD YOU CAN DO
%
 IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING IN LIFE YOU MUST RISK FAILING COMPLETELY AND SPECTACULARLY
%
NO GREAT MIND HAS EVER EXISTED WITHOUT A TOUCH OF MADNESS
%
 FINGERING
%
 ADDICTIONS ARE EXPENSIVE, SO KEEP THEM HEALTHY AND FUN
%
YOU DON’T NEED A MENTOR OR CO-FOUNDER TO START, YOU JUST NEED TO STOP MAKING EXCUSES
%
 TIME IS THE ONLY CURRENCY THAT MATTERS
%
A DAY IS AN AMOUNT OF TIME NO MAN IS WEALTHY ENOUGH TO WASTE
%
NO ONE IS COMING TO SAVE YOU
%
 YOU DON’T ALWAYS NEED A PLAN
%
THE ACT OF TAKING THE FIRST STEP IS WHAT SEPARATES THE WINNERS FROM THE LOSERS
%
LESSONS IN LIFE WILL BE REPEATED UNTIL THEY ARE LEARNED
%
EXERCISE IS A CELEBRATION OF WHAT YOU CAN DO, NOT A PUNISHMENT FOR WHAT YOU ATE
%
MOST PEOPLE ARE ABOUT AS HAPPY AS THEY MAKE UP THEIR MINDS TO BE
%
BIG PROBLEMS ARE BEST SOLVED IN SMALL PIECES
%
IF YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND, ASK BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE
%
 DON’T PUT CELEBRITIES ON RIDICULOUS PEDESTALS
%
IT’S BETTER TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT OTHERS CRITICIZE THAN TO CREATE NOTHING AND CRITICIZE OTHERS
%
DON’T LOOK AT WHAT PEOPLE SAY
%
THE WEAK CAN NEVER FORGIVE
%
THE GREATEST GLORY IN LIVING LIES NOT IN NEVER FAILING, BUT IN RISING EVERY TIME WE FALL
%
 WITHOUT DEVIATION FROM THE NORM, PROGRESS IS NOT POSSIBLE

YOUR CONSISTENCY DICTATES YOUR SUCCESS

 DO IT FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO SEE YOU FAIL
